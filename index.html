<h2>Fallout: New Vegas Mod</h2>
<p>I tried to make a playable area in FNV similar to the rest of the vaults in the game using the GECK engine. I had a lot of trouble using the software because of how it catagorised objects, the saving system and I knew little about certain particular functions. The game had a lot more assets than I originally thought, and a very basic catagory system. It only sorts thisngs by filename so assets that were relevant to eachother could be hundreds of files apart. I did a lot of trial and error trying to find the correct things. Saving was also an issue big issue. I'm not too sure how it works because it won't let me save to the file in use, so I made two different files to use that I would switch between. Even then sometimes chunks of structures wouldn't save. On the other hand I did learn a lot about how the developers went about making the game and I could easily modify parts of the game that already existed.</p>
